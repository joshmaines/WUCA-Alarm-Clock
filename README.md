WUCA Wake Up Call Application
===========

Based on m1dnight's Alarm-Clock: https://github.com/m1dnight/Alarm-Clock

Added features:
1. Full-screen button that toggles full-screen mode.
2. Resizable window with side docking support.
3. Snooze button! (Stops the alarm sound/song and replays it in 5 minutes.)

Possible future features:
1. Ability to save song choices to profiles or playlists.
2. Suggestions welcome!

Note:  Currently, this is just a fork of m1dnight's project.  It is a placeholder and does not actually have any differences.  I will publish my changes very soon, though.
